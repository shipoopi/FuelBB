Things to know before starting
--------------------------------------
- I'm French (Yeah, I know…)
- I'm new to Git & GitHub
- I'm new to FuelPHP (but I'm a former CodeIgniter dev so I'm not completly lost…)
- I'm just a junior dev
- I don't know anything about those Markdown things!

This project is my first, real, open-source, real-world project. We'll see what it will become!
